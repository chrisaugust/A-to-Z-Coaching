          <h2>Coaching Approach</h2>
          <p>
      Life is an incredible journey filled with challenges, exciting milestones, and unexpected twists and turns. Sometimes having a trained professional to talk with and share life’s challenges is beneficial to explore feelings, learn new skills, and tap into strengths and strategies.

      As a Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist and a California credentialed teacher, I have over 18 years of experience working with families, teens, children, couples, and individuals. My work centers around people and my goal is to help people discover and learn to integrate and work with their strengths, passion, and potential. I integrate my therapeutic education and experience to empower, to encourage, and to equip the people I work with in a mindful “here and now” way.
